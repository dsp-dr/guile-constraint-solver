=== Lean4 Integration Journey ===

## Context:
After establishing a solid foundation with Guile Scheme and Z3 SMT solver,
we added Lean4 to create a comprehensive constraint solving framework with
formal verification capabilities.

## Architecture Decisions:

1. **Three-Language Approach**:
   - Guile: Rapid prototyping and native CSP implementation
   - Z3: SMT solving for constraint satisfaction
   - Lean4: Formal verification and proof of correctness

2. **Org-mode Literate Programming**:
   - lean4-integration.org serves as documentation and source
   - Tangling generates all Lean4 source files
   - Maintains consistency with setup.org approach

3. **Lake Build System**:
   - Standard Lean4 project structure
   - Executable for running examples
   - Library for verification framework

4. **Problem Selection**:
   All problems from Hillel Wayne's article:
   - Change Making: DP with optimality proofs
   - Stock Trading: Profit maximization with invariants
   - Three Sum: Constraint formulation with sign assignment
   - Histogram Rectangle: Geometric constraints

5. **Verification Strategy**:
   - Use omega tactic for arithmetic proofs (Z3 backend)
   - Property-based testing framework
   - Comparison framework between implementations

## Implementation Details:

1. **Sentinel Integration**:
   - .lean4-built sentinel for idempotent builds
   - Consistent with existing gmake patterns

2. **Proof Techniques**:
   - omega tactic leverages Z3 for arithmetic
   - Structural proofs for algorithm properties
   - sorry placeholders for complex proofs

3. **Interoperability**:
   - compare-solutions.scm bridges Guile and Lean4
   - Common problem instances across languages
   - Verification of solution equivalence

## Build Flow:
1. gmake setup-lean4        # Install Lean4 toolchain
2. gmake lean-build        # Build Lean4 project
3. gmake lean-run          # Execute examples
4. gmake lean-verify       # Check proofs
5. gmake compare          # Compare all implementations

## File Organization:

```

## Testing Approach:
- Unit proofs for individual properties
- Integration tests via example execution
- Cross-validation between implementations
- Formal verification of optimality claims

## Future Extensions:
- More sophisticated proof automation
- Performance benchmarking framework
- Additional constraint problems
- Interactive proof development

This integration completes the vision of a multi-paradigm
constraint solving framework with both computational and
verification capabilities.
