=== Implementation Details ===

## Makefile Design Decisions:
- BUILD_DIR=.build for all generated files and sentinels
- Sentinel files (.setup-done, .deps-installed) ensure idempotent operations
- Pattern rules: $(BUILD_DIR)/test-%.done and $(BUILD_DIR)/%.done for scalability
- GUILE := guile3 explicitly targets Guile 3.x
- Order-only prerequisites (|) prevent unnecessary rebuilds

## Z3 Interface Robustness:
- Replaced pipe-based communication with temp files to fix Guile 3 segfaults
- Added proper error handling with catch blocks
- Temp files: /tmp/z3-input.smt2 and /tmp/z3-output.txt for reliability

## Emacs Integration Architecture:
- Auto-detection via locate-dominating-file finding setup.org
- Mode-specific keymaps: gcs-guile-mode-map, gcs-z3-mode-map, gcs-lean-mode-map
- File templates for rapid constraint problem development
- Geiser integration with project-specific load paths

## Build Performance:
- Sentinel-based dependency tracking prevents redundant work
- Parallel test execution via pattern rules
- Automatic variable usage ($@, $<) for maintainability

## Testing Infrastructure:
- Fixed SRFI imports for Guile 3 compatibility
- Added robust test harness with .done sentinels
- Support for both unit and integration test patterns

## Development Workflow:
- gmake help as default provides immediate guidance
- Color-coded help output for better UX
- Clean separation of concerns: setup, test, examples, cleanup
- Comprehensive .gitignore prevents tracking of ephemeral files

This implementation provides a solid foundation for constraint solving research
with proper development practices and cross-platform compatibility.
